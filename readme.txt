Create a simple blog with CodeIgniter that has content classification and matching.

How-to:

1. Create a database named CI05.

2. Import the MySQL schema file (schema.sql).  This will also create several clssification categories and 
   eight posts that hve been classified across the range of the categories.  You can use this content as
   test case for improvements to classification and filtering.

3. Change the config.php and database.php according to your settings.

Thanks.
